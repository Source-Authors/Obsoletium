* Open `<GAME_NAME>_<ARCH>.sln` in source directory.
* Set `launcher_main` project `Command` property to `$(SolutionDir)..\game\hl2.exe`.
* Set `launcher_main` project `Command Arguments` property to `-dxlevel 85 -windowed`.
* Set `launcher_main` project `Working Directory` property to `$(SolutionDir)..\game\`.
* Click on `Set as Startup Project` menu for `launcher_main` project.
