  libjpeg-turbo Licenses
  ======================
  
  libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:
  
  - The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
    [README.ijg](README.ijg)
  
    This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
    (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)
  
  - The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below
  
    This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
    well as the build system.
  
  - The [zlib License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib)
  
    This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
    SIMD extensions.
  
  
  Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
  =========================================
  
  This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
  best of our understanding.
  
  1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
      then:
  
      1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
          from the source.
  
          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License
          - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
          - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License
  
      2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
          file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
          there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
          simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)
  
          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License
          - Clause 2 of the zlib License
  
      3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
          copyright or license text in that file.
  
          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License
  
  2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
      if you are distributing an application that statically links with
      libjpeg-turbo, then:
  
      1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:
  
          This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
          Group.
  
          **Origin**
          - Clause 2 of the IJG license
  
      2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
          your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
          License (see below.)
  
          **Origin**
          - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License
  
  3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
      contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.
  
      **Origin**
      - IJG License
      - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License
  
  4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
      free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
      consequences resulting from your use of the software.
  
      **Origin**
      - IJG License
      - Modified BSD License
      - zlib License
  
  
  The Modified (3-clause) BSD License

  CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
  ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
  
  
  Why Three Licenses?
  ===================
  
  The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
  License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
  conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
  libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
  License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
  attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
  desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
  that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.

  CC0 1.0 Universal

  Statement of Purpose

  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
  exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
  subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
  authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
  
  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
  purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
  works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
  claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
  and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
  purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
  contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
  further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
  reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
  efforts of others.
  
  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
  of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
  Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
  and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
  and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
  Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
  effect of CC0 on those rights.
  
  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
  protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
  Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
  to, the following:
  
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;
  
    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  
    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;
  
    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
    a Work;
  
    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
  
    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
  
  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
  applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
  unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
  and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
  known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
  action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
  duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
  extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
  copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
  commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
  the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
  detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
  shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
  any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
  by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
  
  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
  judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
  shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
  Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
  is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
  non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
  unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
  the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
  provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
  purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or

  A light-weight compression algorithm.  It is designed for speed of
  compression and decompression, rather than for the utmost in space
  savings.
 
  For getting better compression ratios when you are compressing data
  with long repeated sequences or compressing data that is similar to
  other data, while still compressing fast, you might look at first
  using BMDiff and then compressing the output of BMDiff with
  Snappy.
