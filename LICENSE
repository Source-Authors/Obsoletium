    OVERVIEW
    ========

    This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
    and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
    method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing
    photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and
    brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or
    other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG
    quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such
    images.

    JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to
    the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images,
    very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression
    artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are
    willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the
    compressor.)

    This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
    compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
    processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
    We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
    processes defined in the standard.

    We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
    plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
    perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
    The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

    In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
    considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
    for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
    decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
    colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
    library if not required for a particular application.

    We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
    different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
    applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

    The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
    flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
    the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
    REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
    be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
    achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

    We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
    No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
    documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.

    REFERENCES
    ==========

    We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
    understand the innards of the JPEG software.

    The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
            Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
            Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
    (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
    applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
    handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
    available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually
    a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
    omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
    and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
    and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

    A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
    "The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
    M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
    good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
    including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
    code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
    sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
    at a full implementation, you've got one here...

    The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still
    Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
    Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
    Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
    standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).

    The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
    specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
    titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
    Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
    10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
    Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
    numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

    The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
    format.  For the omitted details, we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
    1.02.  JFIF version 1 has been adopted as ISO/IEC 10918-5 (05/2013) and
    Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011): Information technology - Digital
    compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange
    Format (JFIF).  It is available as a free download in PDF file format from
    https://www.iso.org/standard/54989.html and http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871.
    A PDF file of the older JFIF 1.02 specification is available at
    http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf.

    The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained from
    http://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation
    scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious
    problems.  IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression
    tag 6).  Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note
    #2 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
    http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
    of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
    Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
    uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.


    ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
    =================

    The "official" archive site for this software is www.ijg.org.
    The most recent released version can always be found there in
    directory "files".

    The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a source of some
    general information about JPEG.  It is available at
    http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq.


    FILE FORMAT COMPATIBILITY
    =========================

    This software implements ITU T.81 | ISO/IEC 10918 with some extensions from
    ITU T.871 | ISO/IEC 10918-5 (JPEG File Interchange Format-- see REFERENCES).
    Informally, the term "JPEG image" or "JPEG file" most often refers to JFIF or
    a subset thereof, but there are other formats containing the name "JPEG" that
    are incompatible with the DCT-based JPEG standard or with JFIF (for instance,
    JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR).  This software therefore does not support these
    formats.  Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software
    was to help force convergence on a common, interoperable format standard for
    JPEG files.

    JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.  TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as
    modified by TIFF Technical Note #2) can be used for "high end" applications
    that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.

  Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
  =========================================

  This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
  best of our understanding.

  1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
      then:

      1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
          from the source.

          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License
          - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
          - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

      2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
          file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
          there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
          simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License
          - Clause 2 of the zlib License

      3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
          copyright or license text in that file.

          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License

  2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
      if you are distributing an application that statically links with
      libjpeg-turbo, then:

      1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

          This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
          Group.

          **Origin**
          - Clause 2 of the IJG license

      2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
          your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
          License (see below.)

          **Origin**
          - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

  3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
      contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

      **Origin**
      - IJG License
      - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

  4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
      free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
      consequences resulting from your use of the software.

      **Origin**
      - IJG License
      - Modified BSD License
      - zlib License


  The Modified (3-clause) BSD License

  CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
  ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


  Why Three Licenses?
  ===================

  The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
  License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
  conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
  libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
  License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
  attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
  desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
  that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.
