# Support

Obsoletium contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please make sure you are using a latest currently-supported version of
Obsoletium.

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [VDC Website](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/), especially the
  [SDK docs](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Docs) or the [Programming](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:Programming)
* [Open or closed issues in the Source-Authors GitHub organization](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort:updated-desc+org:source-authors+is:issue)

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial
resources:

* [Questions tagged 'source-engine' on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/source-engine)

**GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.**

The open source license grants you the freedom to use Obsoletium. It does not
guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage
your expectations.
