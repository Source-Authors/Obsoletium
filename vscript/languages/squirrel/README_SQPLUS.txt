To build and test the minimalSqPlus/ example:

Open Squirrel.sln and build for Debug and Release.

Open the minimalSqPlus/minimalSqPlus.sln and build (Debug or Release), then run.
Alternatively, after building testSqPlus2 in Squirrel.sln, set minimalSqPlus as
the Startup Project, then build and run (dependencies are not set for minimalSqPlus
to illustrate building with pre-compiled libs).

See testSqPlus2/testSqPlus2.cpp for many examples (in the Squirrel.sln solution).

testSqPlus/testSqPlus.cpp is included to show how the old version using macros was used (it is no longer updated).
