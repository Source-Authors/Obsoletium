  * Removed testSqPlus2


2008-06-26 arst@users.sf.net

  * SquirrelVM.cpp / SqPlusSetup.h
    - Added a new define SQPLUS_SQUIRRELVM_WITH_SYSTEMLIB
      (Juggernaut, http://squirrel-lang.org/forums/2585/ShowThread.aspx#2585)
    
    - Added a new function:
      SQClassDefBase::scriptVar(const SQChar* name, int ival, 
                                SQBool static_var=SQFalse)
	
      It allows for creating either static or ordinary Squirrel class
      members from C++ source code. Versions for int/double/const
      SQChar*.
   
    - SquirrelObject::GetBase() - retrieve base class.

  * sqplus.h/.cpp
  
    - SQ_USE_CLASS_INHERITANCE_SIMPLE is a new way of handling class 
      inheritence in SqPlus, relying on a template scheme (see ClassTypeBase 
      and ClassType<T>). It doesn't use any memory per instance and should 
      be a bit faster than previous scheme. SqClassDef has been given
      a second template argument to account for this: 

        struct SQClassDef<MyClass, TheBaseClass> ...
        
    - The name of the class (in SqClassDef) can be filled in by SqPlus now, 
      if Squirrel class name is same as C++ class name:
       
         SQClasDef<Troll, Creature>("Troll", "Creature").func(...) => 
         SQClasDef<Troll, Creature>().func(...)

    - Code to handle class types (names, copy funcs, ID tag, ...) has been 
      collected in ClassTypeBase and ClassType<T>.

    - A new macro to specify that classes should not be copied with default 
      C++ method: DECLARE_NONCOPY_TYPE(ClassThatCannotBeCopied).
     
    - Reworked body of repetetive template functions, Moved to 
      SqPlusCallTemplates.h. Can be included with different qualifiers
      (const, cdecl).
     
    - Support for cdecl member functions (MSVC specific) through: 
   
        SQPLUS_ENABLE_CDECL_MEMBER_FUNCTIONS
       
      cdecl functions are compatible across compilers, while thiscall 
      is not.
     
    - Generic Push/Pop/Match handlers: SQPLUS_USE_GENERIC_HANDLERS
      By default, Push/Get/Match handlers are for a single type. This
      adds a fallback level, so that `hierarchy wide' handlers can
      be used (define for base class and let all derived classes use 
      just that).
     
    - For functions that return a pointer to a temporarary (such as 
      returning a SQDefCharBuf, a template mapper class: 
     
        Temporary<T>::type 
        
       was added. It can hold a temporary value while finishing a 
       SquirrelFunction call (before returning to C++).
   
    - Suppressing horrible warnings from Visual C++ about sprintf and related
      functions (_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE).
  
  
  * SquirrelVM.h/.cpp
  
    - Changed SquirrelVM and SquirrelVMSys to make them hold a reference 
      on a SQVM so that ownership can be shared in a defined way. 
      
    - SquirrelVMSys can be used as before to swap the `active' VM. 
      Now it holds a ref to a VM so that a VM is closed automatically
      when switched out and there are no refs to any longer. (To hold a 
      VM ref in the application, simply use an instance of SquirrelVMSys).
      
    - NOTE: A VM created through sq_open() comes out with a reference 
      count of 1. A VM created with sq_newthread() arrives with a ref 
      count of 0. SquirrelVM will compensate for this.
    
    - Possibility to store a `sandbox VM'. This VM is not allowed to
      access functions / classes bound with SqPlus and so can run more
      untrusted scripts.
    
    - Hopefully these changes will not break current apps. (Note: creating
      and keeping correct refs on SQVM involved some difficulties (with ref-
      counting and garbage collected Squirrel). The scheme provided here is 
      (I hope) a working solution.)
    
  * SquirrelObject.h/.cpp 
  
    - Added: operator = (HSQOBJECT)
    
    - From forum: (http://squirrel-lang.org/forums/thread/2506.aspx)
      (suggested by auron0)
      - Added: operator == (const SquirrelObject& o)
      - Added: CompareUserPointer(const SquirrelObject& o)
    
  * SqPlusUTF8.h / .cpp  
  
    - New files for converting strings in arguments (UTF8 <-> wchar_t)
    
    - Fix for conversion of UTF8 sequence of length 3+ bytes

    functionality

  * SqPlus tested on Mac OS-X


2005-11-03 "SQUIRREL2_0_5_sqplus_6"

  * Fixed inheritance issue: tables added to classes are not newly

2005-10-14 "SQUIRREL2_0_5_sqplus_3"

  * Added support for SquirrelObject as a function argument and return
    value. Tables and arrays can be directly accessed without using
    the stack. This also makes it possible to return tables, arrays,
    classes, and closures for later use at runtime, saving look-up
    overhead

  * Added GetRet() for SquirrelFunction<> to ensure proper stack
    behavior

  * Added additional error return info to help with debugging

  * Removed unused code
